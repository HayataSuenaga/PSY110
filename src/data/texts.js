export const hypothesis = 'Write your hypothesis. Compared to a theory, which is an explanation and prediction of a phenomenon, a hypothesis is more specific. A hypothesis must be testable. In other words, a hypothesis is a prediction that you can either support or rebut based on results of an experiment.';

export const operationalDef = 'List out operational definitions. If you have any unclear terms that can permit several interpretations, define the term\'s specific meaning in the context of your hypothesis.';

export const variableText = 'List out variables that needs to be measured in the experiment. Variables need to be quantitative. If you have any qualitative variables, think how you can use any quantitative measurements to represent qualitative variables. There are two kinds of variables -- dependent and independent. An independent variable is an aspect of an experiment you control. You are going to measure how dependent variables change as a result of manipulations on independent variables.';

export const populationText = 'You need to define the scope to which you test your hypothesis. Is your hypothesis about students of your school? Or students in four-year universities in the U.S.? Or adults in Western countries? Think about how much generalization you want from the result of your experiment. That defines the population of interest for your experiment. It is ideal to use the "random sampling method" -- randomly selecting the subject of your experiment from the population of interest. However, it is also a convention to use "convenience sampling method," in which an experiment\'s subject are chosen from a subset of the population that is easily obtained. When using convenience sampling method, the subset of the population is not biased in any significant way.';

export const confoundText = 'In conducting experiments, it is common that unintended variables are introduced in the experiment environment. These variables are called confounds and can distort experiment results. It is crucial that preventive measures are taken in advance to prevent any confounds from influencing the experiment. Think deeply and list out all potential confounds that might be introduced in conducting your experiment. For each confound, write down what preventive measure you are going to take.';
